## Description
Sparse reduced-rank regression is an important tool to uncover the large-scale response-predictor association network,  as exemplified by modern applications such as the diffusion networks, and recommendation systems. However, the association networks recovered by existing methods are either sensitive to outliers or not scalable under the big data setup. In this paper, we propose a new statistical learning method called robust parallel pursuit (ROP) for joint estimation and outlier detection in large-scale response-predictor association network analysis.  The proposed method is scalable in that it transforms the original large-scale network learning problem into a set of sparse unit-rank estimations via factor analysis,  thus facilitating an effective parallel pursuit algorithm.  

This project contains four folders: `data`, `results`, `src`, `scripts`.
- `data`：include two datasets used in the paper.
- `results`: include the experimental results.
- `src`: include the source codes.
- `scripts`: include codes to directly replicate the experiments in the paper.

## Replicating
To get the results in the results folder, please download and run the codes in the scripts folder. Specifically, to run the .R code in each .zip file with the corresponding name to get the results. For example, to obtain Table 1 in the article, download the file named "Table1 Figures1-5.zip" and run the "Figure1.R" script to obtain Table 1.

See the readme.md file in each folder for a detailed description.
