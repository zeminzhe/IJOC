## main codes
- RS1.R for the proposed method
- r4.1.R for R^4 method from She and Chen (2017): we slightly modify it to fix the maximum rank of this method for fair comparsion with competing methods
- secure.R for sequential cosparse factor regression proposed by Mishra et al. (2017)
- RCGL.R for rank constrained group Lasss proposed by Bunea et al. (2012)
- RRR.R for reduced rank regression (RRR) for low-rank estimates
- GCN.py for Graph Convolutional Network
- GAR.py for Graph Attention Networks
